# CS50 Forensics Without C

## Introduction

[CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?gclid=CLXx9oP_ssYCFUjJtAoddvUODA) is a
course offered on EdX by Harvard which teaches Computer Science using mostly C and a wide variety of problem sets. One of
the more interesting of these problem sets is the Forensics Problem Set - where you must recover JPEG files from a raw card file.

Inspired by [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)
this Repo contains solutions to the Forensics Problem Set in languages other than C to give a slightly more challenging introduction
to programming languages than hello world.
